## Overview
Search bar day, wrapping up bugs.

## Log
### 9:00 PM
#### Challenge/Motivation
Working on the search component.

#### Actions Taken
Today I spent most the morning working on getting the search bar to live search without triggering too many re renders. After I moved my axios request to the most parent component, and shifted where I was executing the search, I was able to live search without too many re renders! Major win. After that, I went through all of the business docs, and marked out every thing that is left to do on trello. The list is long, but mostly everything is small ticket items.

#### Results Observed
I have said this before, but planning out the flow of data right away would have been beneficial. I had thought about it, and was trying to keep my code separated as much as possible, but I should have moved the get request to the parent component sooner and it would have saved me some headache.
