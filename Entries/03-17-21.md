#### Challenge/Motivation
Choosing and writing schemas.

#### Actions Taken
This first portion was all about choosing what database we wanted to use as our primary, and what we would use as a secondary. One had to be SQL and one NoSQL. I chose to use PostgreSQL for the relational database. I have become comfortable with MySQL and wanted to challenge myself with a new technology. Also, Josh Elder recommends it, and Teddi Maull has worked with it in previous jobs, so I know the support will be there if and whenI need it.

Creating the schema for PostgreSQL was a fun experience and I am looking forward to seeing Teddi's notes on what needs changed. Looking at the data from the API as an object and converting that into a relational data structure was a challenge, but after converting it, I can imagine querying the data will be far more simple in this relational form.

#### Results Observed
I can see the benefits of both relational and non relational databases, but at this point in time, I can think of many more instances where a non relational database would be useful.
